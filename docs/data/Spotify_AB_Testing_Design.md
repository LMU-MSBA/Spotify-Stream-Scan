# A/B Testing Design for Spotify Playlists

## Metrics
**Key Performance Metrics:**
1. **Play Count:** Number of times tracks are played. This directly reflects user interest and engagement with the content.
2. **Skip Rate:** Proportion of skips over plays. Lower skip rates may indicate higher satisfaction with the recommended tracks.
3. **Playlist Adds:** How often tracks are added to users' personal playlists. An indicator of users' long-term interest in the content.
4. **Follows:** Number of follows for the artist after track exposure. This can indicate a deeper level of user engagement and potential loyalty.

*These metrics were selected because they collectively give a comprehensive view of user engagement, from immediate reactions to long-term interest and relationship with the artist.*

## Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no difference in engagement metrics between users exposed to playlists of pop artists and those exposed to playlists of non-pop artists.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Users exposed to playlists of non-pop artists will show different engagement metrics compared to those exposed to playlists of pop artists.

## Experimental Design
- **Control Group:** Users who will be exposed to playlists of pop artists.
- **Experimental Group:** Users who will be exposed to playlists of non-pop artists.
- **Randomization:** Users will be randomly assigned to either the control or the experimental group to ensure the groups are statistically similar.
- **Duration:** The test will run for a period of 30 days to collect sufficient engagement data.
- **Sample Size:** Calculated based on anticipated effect size, desired power of 0.8, and alpha of 0.05. The exact number will be determined using a sample size calculator.

## Implementation Plan
- **Technical Requirements:** Utilize Spotify API through Spotipy, user analytics tools, and a server or cloud function to manage assignments and data collection.
- **Timeline:** Preparing the test (2 weeks), running the test (4 weeks), analyzing results (2 weeks).
- **Ethical Considerations:** Ensure user privacy is respected, data is anonymized, and users are aware that data may be used for research purposes.

## Data Collection and Analysis
- **Data Collection:** Data will be collected automatically via Spotify's built-in user engagement analytics and additional tracking implemented via Spotipy.
- **Statistical Methods:** Use of t-tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables to determine significant differences between control and experimental groups.
