# Project Description:

We are assisting Spotify talent managers in determining the viability and potential success of signing a new artist for the platform. The problem we aim to solve is to assess whether there is a demand for the new artist's music and how they can be leveraged to gain popularity. This involves analyzing characteristics of popular artists in the same genre, understanding factors driving popularity, and predicting the potential success of the new artist based on current trends. Inspired by a job post for an Associate Data Scientist, Content Analytics for Spotify, our project aligns with tasks such as analyzing music trends, crafting data-driven insights, and evaluating content recommendations.

# Project Structure:
