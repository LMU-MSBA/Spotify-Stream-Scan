# Project Description:

We are assisting Spotify talent managers in determining the viability and potential success of signing a new artist for the platform. The problem we aim to solve is to assess whether there is a demand for the new artist's music and how they can be leveraged to gain popularity. This involves analyzing characteristics of popular artists in the same genre, understanding factors driving popularity, and predicting the potential success of the new artist based on current trends. Inspired by a job post for an Associate Data Scientist, Content Analytics for Spotify, our project aligns with tasks such as analyzing music trends, crafting data-driven insights, and evaluating content recommendations.

# Project Structure:

code: Contains all the code files used for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

dashboards: Stores interactive dashboards and visualizations showcasing insights derived from the data.

data: Contains datasets used for analysis, including artist characteristics, genre trends, and streaming metrics.

docs: Stores project documentation, including README files, data dictionaries, and analysis reports.

presentations: Contains presentation slides prepared for senior management and stakeholders, showcasing key findings and recommendations.

tests: Stores unit tests and validation scripts used to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.
